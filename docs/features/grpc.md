# GRPC routes

!!! warning
    We tested grpc support only by looking at resources state as traffic providers didn't support grpc well at the moment of development but it would be great if you contribute a real example

To use GRPCRoute:

1. Install your traffic provider
2. Install [GatewayAPI CRD](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api) if your traffic provider doesn't do it by default
3. Install [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/)
4. Install [Argo Rollouts GatewayAPI plugin](installation.md)
5. Create stable and canary services
6. Create GRPCRoute resource according to the GatewayAPI and your traffic provider documentation
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GRPCRoute
metadata:
  name: first-grpcroute
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: traefik-gateway # read documentation of your traffic provider to understand what you need to specify here
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: argo-rollouts-stable-service # stable service you have created on the 5th step
          port: 80
        - name: argo-rollouts-canary-service # canary service you have created on the 5th step
          port: 80
```
7. Create Rollout resource
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    canary:
      canaryService: argo-rollouts-canary-service
      stableService: argo-rollouts-stable-service
      trafficRouting:
        plugins:
          argoproj-labs/gatewayAPI:
            grpcRoute: first-grpcroute # grpcroute you have created on the 6th step
            namespace: default # namespace where your grpcroute is
      steps:
        - setWeight: 30
        - pause: { duration: 2 }
  revisionHistoryLimit: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rollouts-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rollouts-demo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: rollouts-demo
          image: argoproj/rollouts-demo:red
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: 32Mi
              cpu: 5m
```
